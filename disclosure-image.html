          <h2>Self-Disclosure</h2>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Auggie is, understandably, rather hesitant to put himself out there
            amongst his peers. His initial attempts at self-disclosure, such as
            revealing his love for Star Wars, is met with mixed results. As a
            result of Julian’s almost immediate rejection, Auggie seems weary of
            divulging more of himself to his classmates.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            When he isn’t met with open hostility or rejection, Auggie is more
            willing to open up; one could even say that after a lifetime of peer
            isolation, he craves that self-disclosure. With the immediate
            acceptance from Summer, Auggie is much freer and willing to let her
            know and see who he truly is, something he reserves for only a
            select few, especially at the beginning of the schoolyear.
          </p>

        <div class="col-md-7">
          <!-- right column, like HTML5 article -->

          <h2>Image Management</h2>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Auggie’s impression management fluctuates between two main versions
            of himself: school-Auggie and home-Auggie.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            School-Auggie is much quieter, and he almost retreats inward in a
            sense aside from his interactions with Summer and Jack Will. This is
            likely a result of social rejection and the fear of further social
            rejection. When his homage to Star Wars braid is mocked, Auggie is
            quick to part with it, adjusting his physical appearance in an
            attempt to avoid further jeers (Chbosky 43 - 58).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            School-Auggie, especially as his confidence grows, does not want his
            parents lavishing him with kisses and affection in front of his
            peers, even though he would gladly accept them at home (Chbosky
            293).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Home-Auggie is much more unguarded, vocal, and child-like. In-part,
            I believe, because his parents encourage and allow for it. Auggie
            does not really have to worry about his words or actions at home
            because they will not be met with the same negative reactions he
            fears from his peers. Auggie also seems to present himself more
            immaturely at times at home because it garners him the attention
            from his mother that he craves. He has even played the petulant
            child storming off during dinner just to get his mom to follow him
            and coax him out (Chbosky 217 - 220).
