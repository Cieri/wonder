          <h2>Self-Concept</h2>

          <p class="mt-4">
            The self-concepts Auggie focuses most on about himself relate to
            physical attributes. He often notes his small, “cauliflower-shaped”
            ears, drooped eyes, and “tortoise mouth”. He and his classmates also
            acknowledge his small stature. Auggie described himself as smart,
            and his opinion on this was unflappable even in the face of Julian’s
            doubts and snide remarks (Chbosky 28 - 30). In addition, Auggie was
            a self-proclaimed Star Wars nerd, although he began taking less
            pride in that fact after it became one of the subjects of Julian’s
            relentless bullying.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            In the beginning of the novel, I believe Auggie also considered
            himself weak, but towards the end, he began to see his own strength
            and courage. Auggie also began the schoolyear extremely shy,
            frequently struggling to speak loud enough for anyone to hear, but
            he slowly came out of his shell as the year progressed, finding it
            easier and easier to express himself to his peers.

          <h2>Self-Esteem</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            At the start of the schoolyear, Auggie had very poor self-esteem,
            and it was only reinforced by the actions and reactions of his
            peers. His low self-esteem almost broke his friendship with Summer
            when Auggie was so dubious of her intent that he accused her of
            feigning their entire friendship. His self-worth was too low to see
            why someone like her would willingly want to be close to someone
            like him (Chbosky 125 - 126).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Auggie’s self-esteem, like most children and even many adults, is
            heavily influenced by his peers. In the beginning, although he made
            some friends and amicable acquaintances, he was still not truly
            accepted by the rest of the study body, and Auggie’s self-esteem
            suffered from these social rejections. As the schoolyear progressed,
            and as the sneers, taunts, and “plague” game subsided, Auggie’s
            self-esteem improved. His self-loathing remarks turned into
            self-deprecating jokes (Chbosky 209 - 210); panic attacks at the
            absence of his mother at a sleepover turned into confident nights
            away with no mother or Baboo to clutch and snuggle (Chbosky 250 -
            256).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            The attention from Summer, in addition to his reunion with Jack
            Will, helped Auggie find value in himself. By the end of fifth
            grade, bolstered by the support of his classmates, Auggie was able
            to proudly walk onstage to receive the Henry Ward Beecher medal and
            believe that he deserved it (Chbosky 306).

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Perception</h2>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Drawing from the perception process, Auggie’s classmates immediately
            hone in on his appearance. Because children are still growing and
            learning how to socialize, Auggie is met with many cruel reactions.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">
            Given the human nature to pick out differences – and often
            reject those differences – Auggie’s peers select Auggie’s clear
            deformities and organize that piece of him in several ways. First
            and foremost, they decide that he is ugly, and he is then
            categorized as a loser based on that factor. After these opinions
            are formed, his classmates interpret this information and adjust
            their behavior accordingly. </p>
            <p class="mt-4">On these assumptions, Auggie is
            determined to be someone worthy of being picked on and someone
            unworthy of their friendship. It is such a collective agreement
            amongst his peers that it even unifies some together in a bid
            against Auggie, with games like the “plague” finding children who
            may not have interacted before suddenly uniting.
