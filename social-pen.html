          <h2>The Social Penetration Model</h2>

          <p class="mt-4">
            The Social Penetration Model represents the stages and levels of
            communication within a given relationship. It is based on two
            factors: breadth and depth of information shared. The Social
            Penetration Model can also be depicted in layers with the outer
            layer offering little personal information, the middle layer
            broaching deeper topics, the inner layer stepping past the walls of
            vulnerability, and the core personality, one’s most honest self
            (Adler and Proctor 86 - 87).

          <h2>August and Jack Will</h2>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Summer, like her name would suggest, was delightful and warm to
            Auggie from the beginning. Their relationship was far easier than
            Auggie and Jack Will’s relationship, which was trying and confusing
            for the both of them. For a reader, this also made the boys'
            relationship a bit more interesting to follow. Their friendship had
            progression, regression, separation, and reconciliation.

          <h2>Their Friendship</h2>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Their relationship began at the outer layer as they’re first
            introduced to each other shortly before the school year began. They
            exchanged few words that day, but their attitudes toward each other
            aired a potential for a deeper connection. When the schoolyear
            officially began, Jack stuck around Auggie, and in each class they
            shared, Auggie sought Jack out like a bastion of companionship. By
            late September, the pair had started moving toward the middle layer
            of the Social Penetration Model when they began earnestly discussing
            the topic of Auggie’s feelings regarding other kids’ disgust for
            him. The conversation even moved into a banter about Auggie’s
            appearance, something he wouldn’t share with just anyone (Chbosky 63
            - 64).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            By Halloween however, the relationship was forcibly shoved back to
            the outer layer with a few thoughtless, but no less caustic, words
            from Jack Will (Chbosky 77 - 78). Suddenly, Jack was no longer the
            person Auggie gravitated to, the classmate Auggie confided in, or
            the recipient of Auggie’s lopsided smile. Much to Jack’s confusion,
            Auggie avoided Jack and gave him nearly the same regard he would
            give a stranger. It took a hint from Summer for Jack to understand
            and issue a guilt-ridden apology to Auggie (Chbosky 152 - 167).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            With the incident finally discussed, the boys quickly bounced back
            to their former relationship that had been teetering just along the
            edge of the middle layer of the Social Penetration Model. The pair
            discussed crushes, Jack’s feelings about the war with Julian, and
            the sensitive topic of the “plague” game (Chbosky 175 - 179). Auggie
            even allowed Jack into his room, his safe escape, where Daisy and
            his plethora of Star Wars paraphernalia resided (Chbosky 180 - 183).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Because children are still developing their social skills and still
            trying to figure themselves – as well as the people around them –
            out, it’s understandable that their relationship does not move past
            the middle layer. While they may not have made it to the inner
            layers of the Social Penetration Model by the end of the novel,
            Auggie and Jack Will established a friendship built upon a
            considerable level of trust and a mutual desire to share with each
            other. In the beginning, Auggie seemed to orbit a still-uncertain
            Jack like the sun, but by the end, both boys felt a gravitational
            pull toward the other.
